description: >-
  CommerceFlow is a production-grade portfolio project built with TypeScript,
  NestJS, and Docker. It showcases my expertise in backend development and
  system architecture by leveraging a microservices-based design. This project
  demonstrates my ability to design scalable systems, implement robust testing
  strategies, and integrate CI/CD pipelinesâ€”all while writing clean,
  maintainable code.
